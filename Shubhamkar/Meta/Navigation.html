<h1>How do I navigate around this HyperTextBook?</h1>

<br/>

<main>

<p>Here, we have tried to take information from "mature" sources - this means that there is negligible simplification of material. This results in minimal loss of information - often, in books directed towards children, there's simplification of ideas resulting into misinformation. (Un/Fortunately, ideas that seemed to complicated on Wikipedia had to be rewritten in simpler words - with lesser unknown words.) On the other hand we have chosen only the 'introductory' parts of the articles on Wikipedia. There seems to be a significant challenge for the learner in digesting so many ideas. It is hoped that the learner takes this challenge in a positive spirit, and learn the skill of endurance. If you didn't understand this paragraph, you may ignore.</p>

<p>You are supposed to use the questions at the end of each page to navigate around. Whenever you encounter those questions, firstly, check whether those are "Level 0" questions. If they are "Level 0" questions, ask yourself - Can you answer them yourself? Do you understand the answer? If not, check them out by clicking. If you do understand them, move on to the next question. If they are not "Level 0" questions, you may ignore them, for the time being. In order to avoid getting stucked, you must understand whatever you are reading and remember it. You may write it down in your notebook as well, in your own words.</p>

<p>If you are tired at after reading a page, then note down the 'Topic' and the 'Route Number' present at the top of the pages. (For pages with the topic 'Meta', there are no 'Route Numbers'.) Once you are refreshed, you can go to the <a href="./List for Organized Study.html">list of all questions</a>, and scroll to that topic. (This 'List of 0 Questions' is also present in the third question at the bottom of the 'Start Here' page. The title of the 'Start Here' page is 'Understanding a Statement on the Internet'.) And click the question, whose number which matches the route number you noted.</p>

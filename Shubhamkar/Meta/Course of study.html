<main>

<p>
We will be covering things that are important for living in this world. 
In my experience, many of these things will not be covered in a regular school syllabus!
The focus is on "Level 0" questions, understanding the answers to which should enable 
you to tackle "Level 1" and "Level 2" questions. Topics covered include Mathematics, Political 
Science, Language, Psychology, Health Sciences, as also topics that will cultivate in you 
the skills such as scientific-attitude, emotional-understanding, and such.
